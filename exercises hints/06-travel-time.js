/* 6. Travel Time
Write a function that ​collects​ and ​orders ​information about traveling destinations. As ​input ​you will receive an ​array of strings​.
Each string will consist of the following information with format:
"Country name > Town name > Travel cost"
Country name will be unique string, Town name will also be unique string, Travel cost will be a number.
If you receive ​the same​ Town name twice, you should keep the ​cheapest​ offer. ​Have in mind​ that one Country may have ​several ​Towns to visit.
After you finish the organizational part, you need to let Steven know which destination point to visit first. The order will be as follows: First sort Country names ​alphabetically ​and then sort by ​lowest​ Travel cost. 

1. See if you can come up with an idea on how you'd break down this one, even if you don't get the code to work! 

Try to comment out your thought process. There are many ways to break this problem down into smaller pieces.
